## Prerequisites

Before starting the challenges, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice
- Required libraries (listed in the [Libraries](#libraries) section)

## Challenges

The challenges are organized into 40 days, each focusing on a specific topic or concept. Each day's directory contains the problem statement, starter code (if provided), and a solution file.

### Day 1: Introduction to Python

- Topic: Variables, data types, operators, and conditional statements
- [Problem Statement](day01/problem.md)
- [Starter Code](day01/starter.py)
- [Solution](day01/solution.py)

### Day 2: Python Data Structures

- Topic: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- [Problem Statement](day02/problem.md)
- [Starter Code](day02/starter.py)
- [Solution](day02/solution.py)

... (Add more days as per the challenges)

## Libraries

The challenges will introduce you to the following libraries:

### PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library primarily used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. You'll learn how to build and train neural networks using PyTorch.

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is another popular open-source machine learning library developed by Google. The challenges will cover TensorFlow's core concepts and its implementation for various machine learning tasks.

### Streamlit

Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to create interactive web applications for data visualization and machine learning models. You'll learn how to build web apps with Streamlit and deploy them.

### Pygwalker

Pygwalker is a Python library for web automation and scraping. The challenges will teach you how to use Pygwalker to automate web interactions and extract data from websites.
